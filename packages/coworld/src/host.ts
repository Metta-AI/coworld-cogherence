// The coworld game-HOST: the `/player` websocket bridge every game runs on the
// Softmax platform. It is the generic half that all games shared by copy — now
// owned here, parameterized by the small game-specific surface (the module, how
// slots map to seats, the results, and the console to serve).
//
// Per slot, BOTH the game-side `RemotePlayerPilot` (`role=pilot`) and the
// external player policy (`role=player`) connect as clients to this bridge; it
// relays frames between them and synthesizes the `welcome` (on player connect)
// and `final` (at episode end) lifecycle frames the protocol defines. It also
// serves the runner-health-checked HTTP surfaces (`/healthz`, the React console)
// and a read-only `/global` spectator feed, captures that frame stream as the
// replay, and writes results + replay through artifact IO.

 * The coworld game-host entrypoint the platform launches (manifest `gameRun`).

 * `COGAME_LOAD_REPLAY_URI` for replay mode — the frozen platform contract),
 * dispatches replay-vs-episode, prints each slot's player URL so the platform can
 * wire the external player containers, and exits 0 once the episode finishes and
 * artifacts are written. Replay mode never "finishes" — the open server keeps the
 * process alive while the platform health-checks it and tears the container down.
